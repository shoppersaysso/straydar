Straydar, an app to report stray cats
​
​
Straydar is an app built to report stray cat sightings. You can report a stray cat sighting by filling out a simple form with basic information and the location you spotted the cat.  You can even upload an image if you managed to snap a photo on your phone. You can then filter through the list of already reported sightings to try to find specific cats.
​
The idea is to help track stray cats and also to help locate ones that might be lost cats that their owners are looking for.
